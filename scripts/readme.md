My main criterion while creating a joke dataset was to have jokes that have good rating. There were lot of jokes available online, that didn't make much sense in my opinion and I felt that, if you feed in garbage, you get garbage out. So, I scraped those jokes, which had more than 50% rating or which had atleast +2 score(upvotes - downvotes) in the case of reddit. Here is the list of websites from where I scraped.
